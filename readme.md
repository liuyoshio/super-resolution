# Satellite Imagery Super-Resolution

## Datasets

`datasets.py` take only the directory that contains high resolution image and  downgrade the image automatically to generate the paired dataset.

It also support passing the custom downgrading method through `downgrading_method`

Down-scaling factor is set to 4. `(h, w) => (h/4, w/4)`

## Models

Adopts `SwinIR`. 

- Input size is (128, 128)
- Output size is (256, 256)

##### Note the output/intput ratio is not the upscaling factor. This is just for matching the models output.
